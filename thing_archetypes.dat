  <thing id="arcHumanAverage" name="Human (Average)" description="The average human archetype is our baseline for character creation, and portrays the most customizable example of a person. You should choose this archetype if you prefer to play “generalist” characters, who are never going to be terrible at anything. You should also choose this archetype if you have a very specific type of character in mind, since this archetype has the most customization options of the four choices.\n\nThe characteristics all start at 2, meaning your character is going to have a hard time increasing any one characteristic to a 4 or 5, but also that your character isn’t going to have any characteristic they are truly lacking in. Likewise, the strain and wound thresholds start at the average 10. Your character starts with more ranks in skills than anyone else, again playing to the idea of being a generalist. Your archetype ability is also a generalist ability.\n\nEffectively, your group gains a Story Point to spend whenever it needs it. And finally, your character starts with the most experience of any of the four archetypes. Just remember, character creation is your only chance to spend XP on characteristics (otherwise, to increase a characteristic you need to purchase the Dedication talent; see page 81). We recommend you spend most of these XP on improving your characteristics, while saving at most 25–35 experience for talents and skills." compset="Archetype" summary="Generalist Human" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="arcHumanLabor" name="Human (Laborer)" description="The laborer archetype represents a character who has a background in some form of manual labor, and who is generally strong and tough. You should choose this archetype if you’re planning on making a character who focuses on fighting, especially fighting in melee combat. You should also choose this archetype if your character has a background of manual labor and hard work.\n\nThis archetype starts with the Brawn characteristic at 3 and the Willpower characteristic at 1. You’re starting with a character who has better than average Brawn (which makes it easier to improve Brawn further), with the trade-off that your character has a worse than average Willpower. You’ll have to either spend valuable experience points buying that back to 2, or be satisfied with this drawback. Likewise, your character’s wound threshold is higher than average, but your strain threshold is lower than average.\n\nFinally, this archetype gets a special ability that lets you turn a single Critical Injury result that your character suffers into the mildest Critical possible. Not only does this protect your character from some debilitating Crit results, but since the only way to permanently die in our game is through some Critical effects, this can even save your character from certain death." compset="Archetype" uniqueness="unique">
