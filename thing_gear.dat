The user can calibrate sensitivity to avoid false alarms by small vermin.\n\nUnder normal conditions, a character using the sensor automatically detects any moving creatures within medium range. Of course, it can’t distinguish friend from foe or identify the creatures. If creatures within range are actively hidden, your character adds [B][B] to Vigilance or Perception checks to notice them while using the motion sensor (instead of spotting them automatically)." compset="Equipment">

  <thing id="eqSmartSystem" name="Smart-System" description="The next evolution of personal computing, this handheld device fits into a pocket or can be worn on a wrist and functions as a personal computer with an incorporated weak AI. Basically, this means your character can talk to their computer and it answers back. The AI isn’t as smart as an average person, and its “weak” status means it can’t learn or evolve, but it does everything a modern computer can do and can even allow futuristic hackers to access and attempt to override security systems.\n\nIn addition to functioning as a personal computer, the smart-system has information stores that allow the wearer to add [B] to any Intellect-based checks they make." compset="Equipment">

They all do roughly the same thing: keep the wearer alive in a vacuum.\n\nGenerally, space suits include the following: multidirectional maneuvering thrusters, a built-in light, a communications device, magnetic-soled boots, and an emergency repair kit that allows the user to fix any small leaks or tears as a maneuver. The space suit also allows the wearer to survive in vacuum for up to four hours." compset="Equipment">
